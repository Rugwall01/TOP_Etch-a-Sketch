# TOP_Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch in JavaScript HTML  and CSS for "The Odin Project."

I veered a little bit away from the project with this one. The instructions call for a hover function that would cause the grid squares to be filled in.

I wanted to add some extra functionality and inadvertently created the hover draw effect while trying to create a click draw and drag draw effect, this only solidified my desire to go further.

So this is more of a SKETCH-PAD than and Etch-a-Sketch: You click to draw or click and drag to draw, you can choose your own color or accept the one randomly generated for you at page load, you can erase from the pad, and you can choose to have the colors start faded and darken with each pass.
